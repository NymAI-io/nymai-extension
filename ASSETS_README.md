# Brand Assets Placement

## Required Assets

To complete the branding implementation, please add the following PNG file:

### Extension (`nymai-extension`)
- **File**: `NymAI_icon.png`
- **Location**: `assets/NymAI_icon.png` (root level `assets/` folder, same level as `src/`)
- **Usage**: Compact "N" icon displayed in popup header
- **Reference**: `/NymAI_icon.png` (Plasmo serves assets from root `assets/` folder)

## Notes
- Plasmo automatically serves assets from the root `assets/` folder
- The popup component has been updated to reference this asset
- Once the PNG file is added to `assets/NymAI_icon.png`, the branding will be complete
